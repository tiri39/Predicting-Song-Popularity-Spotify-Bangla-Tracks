# Predicting-Song-Popularity-Spotify-Bangla-Tracks
In the ever-evolving music industry, the ability to
predict the potential popularity of a song before producing it
can make impactful changes, leading to commercially successful
music production. In this project, we present a methodology to
predict if a song is going to be hit on Spotify. At present, Spotify is
one of the most used music streaming services and a popular song
on Spotify is likely to be commercially successful. To determine
the features that make a song popular, we analyzed a diverse
collection of Spotify tracks across 125 genres. We evaluated
various machine learning classification and regression techniques
to predict a song’s popularity score that represents its possible
level of popularity.
